								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Andrea Lee, MPA, Manager of External Affairs</em></p>
<p>April was National Volunteer Month, which to me, is a month of possibilities: possible connections, possible relationships, possible awakenings to one’s own city.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to connecting community members to UCAN’s programs and people in meaningful ways. Through these relationships across geography, wealth, age, race, and everything else, we build empathy and see each other’s humanity beyond our facades.</p>
<p>Case in point: A chance connection last fall has led to a supportive bond between a community member and a young person living in UCAN’s Diermeier Therapeutic Youth Home. I happened to sit beside a woman at the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council’s (NLCCC) meeting to launch their Quality of Life plan, to which UCAN is a key contributor. She mentioned she wanted to get involved in North Lawndale, so I learned that her name is Kenya Harris and we setup an appointment to discuss mentorship at UCAN. Today, she is the mentor to a 13 year-old who lives at the Therapeutic Youth Home and who has no other community supports or family. When I asked Kenya what it feels like to be a mentor, she responded:</p>
<p>“Being a mentor makes me feel good and is truly a blessing.  To be part of a support system to a child in need is very rewarding.  I feel lack of support is the primary reason many people have difficult times in their lives.  For me, being a mentor is about letting my mentee know that she has my support and I care.”</p>
<p>The relationship can get complex, and the mentee sometimes asks for more than a mentor can give. I asked Kenya what was challenging about being a mentor, and she wrote:</p>
<p>“I never want her to feel like if I’m unable to do something it’s due to lack of care.  So, I’m currently in the stage of creating healthy boundaries through communication so that she knows I care and if it’s something with in my powers to do, I will.” <img class="size-medium wp-image-6438 alignright" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-268x201.jpeg" alt="" width="268" height="201" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-268x201.jpeg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-320x240.jpeg 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-966x725.jpeg 966w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-720x540.jpeg 720w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-290x218.jpeg 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/use-this-one-2-369x277.jpeg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s a chance connection with a large institution, like the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). On a whim, UCAN applied to receive products made by students during “Make Mondays Matter,” a few hours oncampus when volunteers assemble goods for distribution. This led to 40 students supporting one of UCAN’s close partners, Stone Temple Baptist Church, during UIC’s MLK Day of Service, and then painting walls and completing a variety of projects at UCAN Academy  Grand during UIC’s Day of Service on April 13. Kennedy Hayes, a UIC graduate student in public administration, took some time recently to reflect on what UIC’s engagement with UCAN has meant to their students.</p>
<p>“Students have been able to see all of the ways that they can get involved so close to campus. UCAN covers so many projects that students can see and work with the issues that are happening in their own community.”</p>
<p>Kennedy also considered what it meant to work with each other, as we are geographically close but different in aims.</p>
<p>“It is vital for UIC to be more than a stand-alone university in the middle of Chicago. Integration with the surrounding community is so important for a thriving and successful population.”</p>
<p>Wrapping up National Volunteer Month is bittersweet. While the volume of projects would be difficult to maintain over the year, these examples highlight volunteerism’s ability to bring individuals and institutions together toward shared goals and a vision for a more cohesive society.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chase Larkin is a living, breathing example of UCAN&#8217;s vision and mission: he went from passively attending a youth group to leading it.  </p>
<p>Chase spent his childhood in Harvey, Illinois, with his mother, grandmother and sister as well as his extended family as neighbors. On weekends, Chase would spend time with his father&#8217;s family on Chicago’s South Side at 93rd Street and Blackstone Avenue.  In both instances, while Chase was surrounded by a community of people who cared about his welfare, there also existed the external influences of gangs and drugs, something both of his parents wanted him to avoid. </p>
<p>So, when in fifth grade, his father relocated to Country Club Hills and invited Chase and his brother to come and live with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to live with my dad and my brother. I had never had that before,&#8221; says Chase. &#8220;So we moved out there, but my mind wasn&#8217;t ready for that environment. I brought a lot of 93rd and Blackstone with me and a lot of Harvey mentality to a peaceful neighborhood. I started to get into a little trouble and my grades started to slip and my mom noticed. Fast forward to high school, my mom started working at UCAN.&#8221;<img class="alignright wp-image-6365 size-medium" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-268x402.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="402" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-268x402.jpg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-320x480.jpg 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-966x1449.jpg 966w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-720x1080.jpg 720w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-290x435.jpg 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_0871-e1554404013590-369x554.jpg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" /></p>
<p>In 2006, Chase&#8217;s mother, Michael Ann Wiley, joined UCAN. She met Fred Long, the current Vice President of Development, who had grown up in UCAN programming. Fred told Michael Ann about a male mentoring program called Project Visible Man (PVM), and she immediately knew Chase should be in it.</p>
<p>She picked him up every Wednesday after school and drove him across the city to the group. At 16, it was a new experience for Chase, and it took him six months for him to begin to open up.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time I just wasn&#8217;t ready to hear it. I was like, ‘I&#8217;m fine doing exactly what I&#8217;m doing.’ But as time passed people really just started being more invested in my life. I would see Fred on non-PVM days and he would ask me how I&#8217;m doing, and Claude [Robinson, Executive Vice President of External Affairs &amp; Diversity] would too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Daniels, a Youth Development Coach at UCAN, would also help get Chase more engaged in the group. It didn&#8217;t take long before Chase was fully invested. Soon after, Claude had Chase began to go on exposure outings via the Striving To Achieve Realistic Success (STARs) program. </p>
<p>By 18, Chase was facilitating PVM. By 19, he was officially a UCAN employee as a Youth Development Coach. </p>
<p>&#8220;It brought out new qualities and skills that I didn&#8217;t know I had,&#8221; he says of leading PVM. For most of his life, he thought he wanted to be a lawyer, but after being in PVM and taking a few college courses in the field, he learned it wasn&#8217;t the right fit. He realized, however, he would have come to that conclusion sooner had he taken the opportunity of a summer internship at a law office during high school.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I would have done that internship, I probably would have figured it out before I took these classes. I was just like, ‘I need to be more intentional about taking opportunities even if they may not sound fun or immediately beneficial, I need to start thinking more long term.’&#8221;</p>
<p>There was one moment that made Chase realize this was what he truly wanted to do. It was at &#8220;Learn and Earn,&#8221; a program in which high school youth attended an event to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and life skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;A youth got mad at a young lady and he punched a hole in the wall. I remember sitting down and having a very good conversation about life in general and it had very little to do with him punching the wall, but it had to do with managing emotions and being productive. We had a very good talk and when he walked away, I could tell during the rest of the program, he would be very intentional about not getting in trouble. It was that one conversation that made all the difference, and it wasn&#8217;t even about punching the wall. We just talked.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, Chase knew he was on the right path. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is my passion. I really enjoy gathering as much information as possible and learn, and I really enjoy spreading that knowledge and see it be beneficial to someone else. My belief is that all the information that I get is not always for me. It&#8217;s selfish of me to hold on to that and not spread it along. I think about the knowledge that I have now, that I didn&#8217;t have when I at 16 and 15, it would be selfish of me to not reach out to the 13 year old and say, “Listen, this is something you might need.’&#8221;</p>
<p>After 11 years as a UCAN employee, Chase reflects on what his career has taught him.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCAN opened my eyes to different opportunities. One thing I learned is that opportunity doesn&#8217;t knock. We think opportunity comes to us, that we either miss it or we don&#8217;t take it, but the truth is opportunities are around us all the time. The reason why we don&#8217;t acknowledge them is because we are not prepared to see them as opportunities, so I think UCAN has opened my eyes to be more prepared to spot opportunities, even when those opportunities aren&#8217;t for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year, Chase was honored with a UCAN President&#8217;s Coin to recognize his spirit, service and teamwork.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UCAN practices and celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion year round, and in honor of International Women&#8217;s History Month held two women-centric events for all genders.</p>
<p>To kick off the month, the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, along with Sisterhood 180, held the second annual Black Women&#8217;s Leadership Brunch on March 27, that brought together a panel of inspiring, successful black female professionals who are leaders within the their respective industry. The panel comprised five women: Rhonda Haynes of the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues, Deborah Olivia Farmer of Brown Farmer Media Group, Inc., Tracie D. Hall of The Joyce Foundation, Cristel Turner of U.S. Cellular, and former news anchor Robin Robinson, now the Director of Community Affairs at the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<img class=" wp-image-6360 alignright" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1.png" alt="" width="380" height="283" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1.png 668w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1-268x200.png 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1-320x239.png 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1-290x216.png 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture-1-369x275.png 369w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" />
<p>The discussion focused on the intersection of gender and race, and the unique obstacles it can create in your personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have nothing to gain by staying small,&#8221; said Tracie Hall. &#8220;I always heard friends talking about making more opportunities for black girls to be queens and princess. I always wanted to be the wizard! I wanted to do magic and have power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone can be a leader,&#8221; added Cristel Turner.</p>
<p>The next event on International Women&#8217;s Day, March 8, was Women &amp; Co&#8217;s &#8220;Celebrating (extra)Ordinary Women.&#8221; Participants explored women&#8217;s history, the history of women at UCAN, and spent an hour &#8220;speed mentoring.&#8221; They learned how to empower, collaborate and encourage girls and women in our lives (including ourselves) to embrace the strength and confidence within them/us.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-6368 alignleft" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="275" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice.jpg 512w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice-268x216.jpg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice-320x258.jpg 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice-290x234.jpg 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/art-peice-369x298.jpg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" />The event concluded with an interactive art piece dedicated to extraordinary women. The keynote speaker was Laura Angelucci, UCAN’s Vice President of Administration, and she went through the history of feminism and intersectionality within the movement. Participants were also treated to &#8220;A Brief History of Women at UCAN,&#8221; which in relation to UCAN&#8217;s full history was anything but brief. </p>
<p>&#8220;(extra)Ordinary Women highlighted a diverse array of talents among women inside and outside of UCAN,” says Rebecca Brown, Development Coordinator at UCAN. “It offered a space for people to connect with each other while learning about the true meaning of feminism &#8211; the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the growing Civil Rights Movement incited detractors in 1959, many faith leaders in Chicago feared backlash and refused to allow Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to preach to their congregations. Reverend James Marcellus Stone, then pastor of Stone Temple Baptist Church, welcomed Dr. King to preach, knowing that a message of justice and love should be welcomed in his church.</p>
<p>On January 26 of 1966, one year after declaring Chicago the epicenter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference&#8217;s civil rights efforts in the north, Dr. King and his wife Coretta moved to a quaint apartment on the West Side of the city in North Lawndale, across the street from the Stone Temple Baptist Church. Stone Temple would go on to become Dr. King’s &#8220;action center&#8221; for the Civil Rights Movement. Though Dr. King&#8217;s apartment is gone, Stone Temple continues to be a pillar in North Lawndale, the home of UCAN’s headquarters.</p>

<p>For the annual ‘MLK Day of Service,’ observed on Dr. King’s  birthday, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Student Leadership and Civic Engagement&#8217;s office reached out to UCAN ready to give back to their community. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had the opportunity to engage UIC students in North Lawndale and felt that our community needed the support more than us,We build up and support youth who’ve suffered trauma,&#8221; says Andrea Lee, Manager of External Affairs Manager at UCAN. &#8220;We work with youth themselves, their families, and their community – like with this project. We had the chance to lead this service project to support pillar in our community of North Lawndale that continues to be an ‘action center’ – of spirituality and community connectedness. In addition to supporting the youth through our programs, we recognize that supporting other community institutions is another critical way to build strong youth and families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty students from UIC arrived at Stone Temple Baptist Church on January 21<sup>st</sup> ready to paint, organize, deep clean, and repair floors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we are celebrating Dr. King while also coming out to support our community,” said Nadine Toussaint, a student at UIC. </p>
<p>Though many people across the country participate in the MLK Day of Service, the UIC students’ day of service was unique in that they gave back to the same community that Dr. King embraced as his own decades before.</p>
<p>“It was really great because some of the community members of the church were hanging out to see what we were doing and encouraging us and thanking us for being there,&#8221; says Samantha Lagestee, another UIC student.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the volunteers had painted two large conference rooms, washed walls in high-traffic hallways, organized the storage room and deep-cleaned the storage area.</p>
<p>“I am grateful for UCAN. I am grateful for the students that came from UIC,&#8221; says Pastor Reshorna Fitzpatrick of Stone Temple. &#8220;I’m just excited today, it’s just a beautiful project taking place. I’m sure if Dr. King was alive he’d be happy to see all of us coming together in one place having a united front.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the very core of UCAN is youth development. It’s the underlying constant within each program, and of the tools used to support their development, mentoring remains one of the strongest and most effective.</p>
<p>“Mentor” can mean someone who you look up to or someone you aspire to be. It can be someone who pushes you or someone who supports you whether a family member or a colleague. </p>
<p>But for two youth at UCAN, mentor means someone who has changed their lives.</p>
<p>Seantayvia Byrd came to UCAN two years ago through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Services program. Now she is a senior in high school and looking forward to her future with the support of her Youth Development Coach Nadia Hill. </p>
<p>“I know that she cares &#8211; for real,” says Seantayvia of Nadia.</p>
<p>As Seantayvia navigates her last year of school, she’s looked to Nadia for help in making decisions about her future. Though she hasn’t applied to college yet, she plans to attend, and when the time comes, Nadia will be there to assist her in the application process and beyond. Her goal: become a psychologist.</p>
<p>Yasmine Kirkwood, another UCAN youth, shares Seantayvia’s enthusiasm for psychology.  She cites her therapist as her mentor.</p>
<p>“I just love her,” Yasmine says. “She gave me more confidence; she helped me come out of my shell. She’s my inspiration. I don’t know what I’d do without her.”</p>
<p>Because of the support and guidance Yasmine received from her therapist after her father died, she knew this is what she&#8217;s meant to do: help people like her. &#8220;Making other people feel good, it helps me.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s good to have a person like that outside of your family,” Seantayvia adds.</p>
<p>Nadia Hill is herself a mentee having spent most of her life in North Lawndale. From a young age, she was active in after school programs such as the Boys and Girls Club. </p>
<p>&#8220;[My mother] was very intentional,” she says, “to make sure I was very involved with community,&#8221; and that connection is a reason she became a youth development coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter who I work with,&#8221; says Nadia. &#8220;I want them to see that they can be self-sufficient.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UCAN offers services that focus on mental health, from traditional therapy to expressive acting and art programs, but healing is at common theme in our programming. </p>
<p>UCAN Survive is a new program funded via a ICJIA (Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority)/VOCA (Victims of Crime Act) grant that is dedicated to healing and supporting victims or witnesses of crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep the same foundation of UCAN,&#8221; says Janay Brinkley, a UCAN youth development coach. &#8220;We believe traumatized youth and families can become leaders as well, but combine that with ICIJA/VOCA (and) we serve victims of crime. That ranges anywhere from burglary, arson, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, harassment; even if you witnessed a crime or experienced a homicide, you’d fall under this service. We deal with clients 13 and up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janay moved to Chicago from Maryland in 2017. &#8220;I felt like I was being called to Chicago,&#8221; she says. Though she had not previously worked in a nonprofit, she joined the UCAN team in April 2018, specifically to be trained and work under the UCAN Survive program.</p>
<p>“What makes us different from other development coaches,&#8221; she explains, &#8220;is that we are like a hybrid that includes mentorship, case management and a form of counseling. We kind of do all three in one.”</p>
<p>The grant allows for 10 youth development coaches, five under Violence Intervention and Prevention Services and five under Counseling and Youth Development, the latter of which is where Janay works. </p>
<p>“We help them with goal setting, jobs, and educational advocacy. We have youth who need us to step in for parent counseling, or help with court, or help with restraining order paperwork. We are your coach, we are your mentor, we are your therapist, and we are your caseworker,” says Janay. &#8220;We want to work smarter not harder. UCAN has group programs like Phenomenal Woman and Project Visible Man. Let&#8217;s do that same group type setting with UCAN Survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCAN piloted a group UCAN Survive program in which individual clients come together monthly in a group setting to address and practice healthy self-coping skills, self-care, confidence, education on the criminal justice system, and encourage hope for the future.</p>
<p>“There have been a lot of success stories,” says Janay. &#8220;There was a client (and) she was a walk-in. She heard about the program and was assigned to my coworker, Ashley . The woman explained that she was walking around with three kids and a newborn baby, living in her car. That day, Ashley helped her get basic needs at the store, gave her the information she needed and helped her get into a shelter. I was in awe of that story. She was support, she was her case manager, she gave her shelter and she gave her tangible thing she needed, all within that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The development coaches have since worked out a system in which one coach has a specified strength that helps determine which client is assigned to whom, whether helping with housing accommodations, employment or mentoring,. </p>
<p>But Janay noticed one unexpected pattern in her clients.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, what really means the most to the client &#8230; it&#8217;s just the time spent.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2002, lightning struck within the halls of UCAN. Three young men took their friendship and talent to new heights by founding the Uhlich Voices program, which is in resurgence and rebranded today as UCAN Voices.</p>
<p>In its infancy, Voices was simply a way for three young men from Chicago’s South Side – Fred Long, Jason Daniels and Victor Spencer – to bond through their passion for song writing, freestyle rap and musical expression.  </p>
<p>Jason started his musical journey near the Rainbow Beach neighborhood in Chicago, playing the violin in the second grade. At the time he was pushed into it by his grandmother, but grew to look forward to the lessons. Facing the turmoil of having two brothers incarcerated, gang fights and gun violence in the streets, Jason spent most of his time in his room practicing violin and writing song lyrics.  Soon he built up the confidence to perform in talent shows at school and found himself surrounded by crowds of his peers as he practiced free style rapping in the lunch room. <img class="size-full wp-image-6132 alignright" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4980_93000759305_5482977_n.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4980_93000759305_5482977_n.jpg 300w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4980_93000759305_5482977_n-268x201.jpg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4980_93000759305_5482977_n-290x218.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This love of music was what soon connected Jason to Fred. Although they went to high school together, both were so focused on keeping their heads down and away from trouble on the streets that they didn’t discover their kinship until playing as teammates on East West College’s basketball team. That’s when Fred introduced Jason to his longtime friend Vic and the three became inseparable, recording dozens of mix tapes in Victor’s apartment that was then part of UCAN’s Transitional Living Program.</p>
<p>“I was a natural show-off,” Jason says.  “But Fred would not rap outside of his laundry room, Vic’s house or on the bus. You could tell he wanted to get into the rap battles I was getting into but he would never do it. So Uhlich Voices was kind of like his coming out party.”</p>
<p>For 6-8 months, the young men cataloged the best songs from their repertoire that could be perfected and combined into a published album. With the help of UCAN’s Executive Vice President Claude Robinson, they learned how to find and network with music industry representatives and secured grant funding from Amistad Foundation to start the recording process in 2004. Once their album was released, the group toured coast to coast for almost three years, performing for crowds of thousands.</p>
<p>Flash forward to 2018: Vic Spencer’s musical career is still on the rise. His album is listed on the top 40 independent charts and he has worked with some of the most lauded artists in the rap music industry, including Chance the Rapper, Mick Jenkins, Vic Mensa and Red Man. His most recent release is a feature on Ghostface Killah’s new album.</p>
<p>Fred Long has also become an example of how UCAN builds future leaders. UCAN offered him an internship after his time in care, and he worked his way through the ranks to become vice president of Development, managing a team of seven to secure resources to contribute to UCAN’s budget of over $40 million to support youth and families in need.  </p>

It was his experiences in New York that brought him back to UCAN with a deeper and more passionate interest in protecting and educating the youth we serve. Jason is currently a youth development coach at UCAN and one of the main parties responsible for bringing the Voices program back into prominence.</p>
<p>Under Jason’s guidance, Voices’ meetings allow for a fun and free-spirited atmosphere without losing any structure or momentum in its therapeutic objectives. Youth rotate every other week between learning the ins and outs of the music business and the tools for engineering, beat making and expressive writing. The other weeks are devoted to recording and allowing each young person to share their story.</p>
<p>Jason says he’s been amazed week to week at the progress our young people make. One youth, James, recently needed a push to realize his potential.  “Before we started Voices I was working with James as a mentor. He had a severe speech impediment. He was very withdrawn and couldn’t make eye contact. One way that I would try to connect with him when I would pick him up from school was playing him songs. He liked blues and some other stuff like that. I thought … let me try something with him. So I started freestylin’ over some instrumentals. It became a thing with us and every time I would pick him up he was looking ready with a new beat to try writing lyrics for.”</p>
<p>The next step was to get James to understand how to work through some his unanswered questions in his life, like his relationship with his father that had put a strain on his development throughout his adolescence.  “A lot of things that have happened to James, he is still searching for answers to. Unfortunately he might not ever get those answers. But music has helped him tremendously with his speech. Within a year you can hardly tell he ever had a stutter or difficulty communicating,” adds Jason.</p>
<p>Jason explains that the Voices program’s goals and expectations have shifted slightly since his time as a member. He plans to host performances and find ways for youth to boost their confidence through recording. But the bulk of the program focuses on therapeutically learning about life through the ins and outs of the music business, and driving home the value of being able to tell your story in a way that other people cannot.</p>
<p>“It is how I got through my hard times when my father was on drugs and I was having a lot of resentment towards him. I had so much anger towards him that I couldn’t bring myself to just sit down and talk with him,” Jason recalls. “I remember writing the song ‘Fathers’ Day’ and just crying. It wasn’t even sadness; it was a release and a weight off of me to express those feelings.”</p>
<p>Jason wants the future of UCAN Voices to provide a similar release for many more youth looking for answers to difficult questions in their lives. “The thing about music is it is a universal language. It takes the power away from those who have hurt you,” Jason says.  “And these youth are learning SO much that they don’t realize will be valuable for their life down the road.”</p>
<p>Thanks to new funding from the Chicago Chapter of The Links Inc., and a blended partnership with UCAN’s Express Therapy program, UCAN Voices is seeing growth in membership and success. If you have an interest in music, spoken word or the performing arts, we welcome guest speakers, volunteers and recommendations for additional funding sources to keep this special resource available to the youth and families we serve.</p>

<li><u>Kingdom Builder&#8217;s Christian Center</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Kingdom Builder’s Christian Center held a Gun Violence Awareness Rally on August 18 where the project’s youth leaders held a uniform and school supplies giveaway along with fun activities and food to promote unity in the community. The youth experienced the satisfaction of putting on a large event and made a difference in the community.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>Sankofa Safe Child Initiative</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Sankofa Safe Child Initiative held a “Girls Speak Out Task Force” forum on August 24. A group of young women watched the film “Hidden Figures” and held a discussion on the topic of self-love and self-esteem. The goals were to decrease violence through discussion, education, and participation. The youth who presented the forum were empowered and learned leadership and service skills, values and commitment.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><u>SAIC – The Art Institute at Homan Square </u></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know time can pass by us in a blur. That is why we give special praise to those who slow down, take some time to reflect, and give a little bit of their most cherished resource… their time.</p>
<p>#TwitterForGood Day happens twice a year around the globe.  This year Twitter conducted over 76 service projects across 16 offices around the world. In Chicago a group of 20 “Tweeps” helped UCAN spruce up their conference rooms by painting Chicago neighborhood murals.</p>
<img class="wp-image-6079 alignleft" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="363" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954.jpg 2448w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-268x357.jpg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-320x427.jpg 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-966x1288.jpg 966w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-720x960.jpg 720w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-290x387.jpg 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Painting-canvases-e1543610683954-369x492.jpg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" />
<p>Twitter was built to foster communication on a global scale because they believe the open exchange of information can be a compelling force for good in the world.  The mission for corporate philanthropy at Twitter is to reflect and augment the positive power of their platform through civic engagement, employee volunteerism, charitable contributions, and in-kind donations.  In these ways, their company can foster greater understanding, equality and opportunities available in cities where they operate. </p>
<p>One of the volunteers from Twitter, Michelle Tomblin, reflected on her experience, “I personally loved getting a better feel for the great work that UCAN does for the Chicago community.  The staff at UCAN really made sure to educate Twitter Chicago on the many programs that UCAN offers including Project Visible Man, crisis prevention, therapy, etc.  I left there eager to find more opportunities where @TwitterChicago and UCAN can partner together in the near future in order to make an impact with the youth of Chicago!”</p>
<p>We’d like to give a virtual high five and pat on the back to our friends at Twitter as well as several other stellar groups of volunteers who went out of their way to give back where UCAN needed them most this year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most impactful ways a loyal donor can enrich the lives of others is through a planned gift. Tilly Wilhoite, a longtime supporter of UCAN, intends to contribute to our youth and families for generations to come through a planned gift. Tilly learned about UCAN from her church, St. Pauls, of which she is a longtime member. UCAN partners with St. Pauls to host their annual Polar Peace March fundraiser and advocacy event that supports UCAN’s program. <img class=" wp-image-5832 alignright" src="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="327" srcset="http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2.jpg 3024w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-268x357.jpg 268w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-320x427.jpg 320w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-966x1288.jpg 966w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-720x960.jpg 720w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-290x387.jpg 290w, http://www.ucanchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tilly1-2-369x492.jpg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<p>“I wanted to continue to give, and had the ability to give, so I began to focus on organizations that impact a change in the culture of violence in Chicago communities; to interrupt that cycle of violence, to make sure you have more tools in the toolbox than to strike out,” she says.</p>
<p>“My kids only need so much,” she laughs. “After I felt that they were taken care of in an appropriate way, I decided everything beyond a certain amount would go towards organizations. After working in Chicago Public Schools for 20 years, seeing the environment of violence, brings me around to supporting the things that UCAN does in terms of violence interruption and violence prevention.”</p>
<p>As Tilly puts it, “As much as it’s an unplanned gift (in terms of budgets), it’s a planned bonus. It can be for an immediate need or a long-term need. It’s not an impact in terms of budgeting today, but a bonus down the road.”</p>
<p>Tilly has put her trust into UCAN after years of following our work. She knows her gift will continue to change lives and impact youth for years to come. “I trust UCAN to use my money wisely, to use it as it is best needed.”</p>
